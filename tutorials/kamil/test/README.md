We are essentially refining the traditional degree-day approach used to measure larval development based on temperature. Normally, we would calculate growth by how many degrees above a minimum temperature the larvae are exposed to and how many days they stay at that temperature. For instance, if larvae need at least 10°C to grow and you keep them at 11°C for a day, you get one degree-day of growth. If you keep them at 12°C, that’s two degree-days per day, and so on.

Now, the twist in our model is that we don’t assume a perfectly linear relationship between temperature and development. Instead, we are using actual experimental data to see how much growth accumulates at different temperatures. So if larvae take 20 days to develop at 20°C, we consider 1/20 of development accumulated each day. If they take only 5 days at 30°C, we adjust to accumulating 1/5 of development per day. This way, our model accounts for how development speeds up or slows down in a more realistic, data-informed manner rather than just relying on a simple linear degree-day calculation.

In addition to refining the degree-day approach, our model also addresses how we "connect the dots" between observed temperature effects. Traditional degree-day models assume a simple linear relationship between the development rates incurred by two different temperatures. Our approach, however, does not rely on that linear assumption. Instead, it introduces a more flexible and realistic way to link temperature to development rates by considering a species-specific non-linear equation to link temperature with development rate. One might test different functions or equations to see which best fits the observed data, rather than assuming a straight line. This gives you a more nuanced and accurate model of how temperature influences development under varying conditions while maintaining the principles of development through heat accumulation in the canonical approach.

Another important addition in our model compared to the standard degree-day approach is that we relax the idea of a fixed heat accumulation threshold for development. Instead of saying that larvae must develop exactly at, say, 3,000 degree-days, we might say that development happens around 30 days, with some standard deviation. In other words, instead of a fixed number of days or degree-days, we can model the timing as a distribution, for example, using an Erlang distribution for development time.

This makes our model more flexible and realistic, capturing natural variability rather than enforcing a single fixed threshold.
